# IGF-Network-Expression-in-the-Brown-Anole
This repository holds all supplemental files for "Gene expression of the IGF hormones and IGF binding proteins across time and tissues in a model reptile".

### Molecular Protocols 
The protocol for molecular processes used in this experiment, RNA extraction through qPCR analysis, can be found [here](Brown.Anole.qPCR.Protocol.pdf). 

Within the molecular protocol, a series of appendices are referenced. [Appendix A](Appendix_A.Primer_Design.txt) contains the gene sequences for IGF1, IGF2, and EEF2 that were used for primer and probe design. [Appendix B](Appendix_B.Standard.Prep.Worksheet.xlsx) contains the excels spreadsheet used to prepare the absolute standard curve. If downloaded, this sheet is easily amendable for use. [Appendix_C](Appendix_C.qPCR.Calculations.xlsx) contains an amendable spreadsheet for qPCR mastermix preparation and plate setup. 

### qPCR Amplification Data Output 
Raw data output files for two plates of qPCR amplification ([Plate 1](qPCR_Plate_10_24.zip) and [Plate 2](qPCR_Plate_2.zip)) were exported from the Bio-Rad CFX Maestro qPCR Analysis Program.
